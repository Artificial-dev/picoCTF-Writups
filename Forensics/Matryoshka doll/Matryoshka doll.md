## Solution

Detailed walkthrough of the steps taken to solve the challenge. Can include:


- Skills/tools/techniques - Stenography/File carving
- Approach<br>
 Starting with research on steganography and hex editors, I followed a YouTube tutorial and found a useful write-up. I came across "stegoVeritas," a tool on GitHub for steganography analysis. Using it with the command
```
kali@root# stegoveritas -carve dolls.jpg         -carve Attempt to carve/extract things from this file 
```
 I uncovered a series of images. Ultimately, I reached "4_c.jpg," revealing a hidden "flag.txt" file.
