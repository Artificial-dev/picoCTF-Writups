# picoCTF-Writups
This public repository contains my writeups and solutions for challenges from picoCTF, a computer security competition focused on security concepts like Forensics, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and web vulnerabilities.
## Challenges ##

This writeup repository is a work in progress containing solutionsa and summary of used tools for some picoCTF challenges. I plan to continue expanding it by solving additional challenges from the Pico primer and documenting step-by-step techniques used.
